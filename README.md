# minecraft-server-downloader
A Perl script for downloading the latest version of Minecraft.

Clone this repo, symlink it into your Minecraft server directory and run it. That's it!

## Purpose
This script will check what the latest released version of Minecraft is, download it, save it as its versioned name, then sym-link that file to `minecraft_server.jar`, so Minecraft can find it.
